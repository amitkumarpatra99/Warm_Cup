# Warm Cup ☕ — Creator Support Platform

Warm Cup is a modern platform designed to help creators (developers, artists, musicians, writers, editors, streamers, etc.) receive support from their audience. Inspired by “Buy Me a Coffee,” Warm Cup brings a clean design, smooth UI, and a warm donor experience.

Creators can receive support, display their work, and grow their community — one warm cup at a time.
